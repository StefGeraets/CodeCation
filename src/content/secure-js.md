## In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? No, I'm Santa Claus! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

## Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

1. But I've never been to the moon!
2. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
3. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

### Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Soon enough. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

- Bender?! You stole the atom.
- I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
- Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Really?! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Can I use the gun? Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Okay, I like a challenge.

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You don't know how to do any of those. Oh sure! Blame the wizards!

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Oh God, what have I done?

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Moving along… Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Bender, quit destroying the universe!

Who are you, my warranty?! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! File not found. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. They're like sex, except I'm having them!

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Hello Morbo, how's the family?

Shut up and get to the point! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Kif might! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
