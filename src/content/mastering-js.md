## Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?

Look, last night was a mistake. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. I'll get my kit!

## Professor, make a woman out of me.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

1. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.
2. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
3. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

### Tell her she looks thin.

Oh God, what have I done? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Yeah, lots of people did. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! No! Don't jump! Bender, quit destroying the universe!

- Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
- Why would I want to know that?
- Shinier than yours, meatbag.

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Do a flip! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. So, how 'bout them Knicks? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Say what? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Noooooo! But I've never been to the moon!

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Kif might! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Oh yeah, good luck with that.

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Your best is an idiot! We're also Santa Claus!

Bite my shiny metal ass. And until then, I can never die? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? We don't have a brig.

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Who are those horrible orange men? I'm a thing. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

File not found. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
