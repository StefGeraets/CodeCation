## Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

You can see how I lived before I met you. Hey, whatcha watching? You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Really?! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

## Pansy.

With gusto. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

1. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!
2. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?
3. We're also Santa Claus!

### Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Say what? I'll get my kit! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Actually, that's still true. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

- We're also Santa Claus!
- Ooh, name it after me!
- Yes! In your face, Gandhi!

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! We're rescuing ya.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Oh God, what have I done? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Oh God, what have I done?

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

You are the last hope of the universe. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Yeah, lots of people did. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

Kif might! Ask her how her day was. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. No, I'm Santa Claus! And I'm his friend Jesus. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Why would a robot need to drink? Negative, bossy meat creature! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. How much did you make me?

Actually, that's still true. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Meh.
