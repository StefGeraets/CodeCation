## You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Why would a robot need to drink? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Pansy. No, just a regular mistake. Soon enough.

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

## Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

1. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
2. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
3. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

### I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. We're also Santa Claus! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?

- If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.
- We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
- No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Kif might! It's a T. It goes "tuh". That's not soon enough! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

Shut up and get to the point! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Kids have names? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Why would a robot need to drink? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

Ooh, name it after me! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Professor, make a woman out of me.

Large bet on myself in round one. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. And then the battle's not so bad? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I'll get my kit! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! It doesn't look so shiny to me. When will that be? Soothe us with sweet lies. One hundred dollars. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Who am I making this out to?

Shinier than yours, meatbag. So, how 'bout them Knicks? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Tell them I hate them. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Really?! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Leela's gonna kill me. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
