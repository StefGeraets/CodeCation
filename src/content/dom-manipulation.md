## Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Then we'll go with that data file! A sexy mistake.

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Professor, make a woman out of me.

## File not found.

Professor, make a woman out of me. Okay, I like a challenge. Professor, make a woman out of me. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

1. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
2. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
3. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

### No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Look, last night was a mistake. I'll get my kit! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

- All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!
- But existing is basically all I do!
- You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Shut up and take my money! You know, I was God once. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Why not indeed! I'm Santa Claus!

Then we'll go with that data file! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. That's not soon enough! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. No, just a regular mistake.

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Belligerent and numerous. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

No! Don't jump! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Look, last night was a mistake. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Daylight and everything. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! With gusto. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

Oh God, what have I done? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I can explain. It's very valuable. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
