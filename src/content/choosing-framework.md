## When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

## And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

I can explain. It's very valuable. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

1. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
2. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.
3. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

### OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

- I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
- I had more, but you go ahead.
- Who am I making this out to?

I never loved you. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Daylight and everything. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

I love you, buddy! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Okay, I like a challenge. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Hello Morbo, how's the family?

Say what? I wish! It's a nickel. Kif might! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. What are their names?

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. You know, I was God once. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? We're rescuing ya.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! When will that be?
