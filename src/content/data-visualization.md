## Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Hello Morbo, how's the family?

Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

## And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

Hello Morbo, how's the family? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

1. Professor, make a woman out of me.
2. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
3. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

### My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Daylight and everything. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Bender, you risked your life to save me!

- Who are you, my warranty?!
- Meh.
- Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! It's toe-tappingly tragic! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! That's not soon enough! Tell them I hate them. And then the battle's not so bad?

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Say what? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

Who are you, my warranty?! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Oh yeah, good luck with that. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
