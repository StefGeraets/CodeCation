## I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. And until then, I can never die? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

Hey, whatcha watching? Shut up and take my money! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

## Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Who are you, my warranty?! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

1. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
2. You can see how I lived before I met you.
3. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

### Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

I'm a thing. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You lived before you met me?! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

- You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
- Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.
- Why would I want to know that?

I just told you! You've killed me! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I wish! It's a nickel. Throw her in the brig. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Bender, quit destroying the universe! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Say it in Russian!

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Moving along… For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. No. We're on the top. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Tell them I hate them. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

Can I use the gun? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! A true inspiration for the children. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
