## It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

They're like sex, except I'm having them! Meh. A true inspiration for the children. Noooooo! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

## Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

Pansy. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that a cooking show? It's a T. It goes "tuh".

1. One hundred dollars.
2. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
3. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

### This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Meh. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Who am I making this out to? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

- You are the last hope of the universe.
- The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
- No, she'll probably make me do it.

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

Ask her how her day was. Ummm…to eBay? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Do a flip! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Look, last night was a mistake. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. And until then, I can never die? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Why not indeed! Also Zoidberg. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? You know, I was God once.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Guess again. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

Shut up and take my money! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Meh. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Hello Morbo, how's the family? I had more, but you go ahead. Bender?! You stole the atom.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Who am I making this out to? No, just a regular mistake. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
