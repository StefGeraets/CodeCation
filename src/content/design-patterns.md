## Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

With gusto. I just told you! You've killed me! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Bender, quit destroying the universe!

And why did 'I' have to take a cab? The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Hey, whatcha watching? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

## Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

1. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
2. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

### As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Look, last night was a mistake. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

- We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.
- We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
- I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Meh. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Is that a cooking show? You are the last hope of the universe.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money. Soon enough. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Who am I making this out to? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

And I'm his friend Jesus. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
