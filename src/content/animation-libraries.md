## Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I can explain. It's very valuable. You lived before you met me?! And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

Yeah, lots of people did. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Leela's gonna kill me. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

## Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

1. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
2. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
3. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

### No. We're on the top.

And then the battle's not so bad? A true inspiration for the children. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

- We're also Santa Claus!
- Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
- Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

I'm a thing. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. You don't know how to do any of those. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Shut up and take my money! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

Hey, whatcha watching? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. No! The cat shelter's on to me. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

You know, I was God once. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Professor, make a woman out of me. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Bender, quit destroying the universe! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! You don't know how to do any of those.

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! You can see how I lived before I met you. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!
