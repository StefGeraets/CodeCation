## Your best is an idiot!

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Professor, make a woman out of me. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

You're going to do his laundry? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Bender, you risked your life to save me!

## Bite my shiny metal ass.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. And until then, I can never die?

1. No argument here.
2. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
3. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

### Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

- Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
- I can explain. It's very valuable.
- Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Bender, we're trying our best. Ooh, name it after me! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I just told you! You've killed me!

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Leela's gonna kill me.

Hey, whatcha watching? No, just a regular mistake. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Hello Morbo, how's the family? That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

No argument here. Look, last night was a mistake. Say it in Russian! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Hello Morbo, how's the family? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

Leela's gonna kill me. You can see how I lived before I met you. Soothe us with sweet lies. Pansy. Bite my shiny metal ass. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I wish! It's a nickel. Ummm…to eBay? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You know, I was God once. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
