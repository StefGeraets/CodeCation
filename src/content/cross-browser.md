## Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Fatal. Why not indeed! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

## You lived before you met me?!

But I've never been to the moon! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

1. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
2. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!
3. Kids have names?

### Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

- You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
- I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
- Ooh, name it after me!

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Kids have names?

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! When will that be? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Throw her in the brig. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Shut up and take my money! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Ow, my spirit! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. You know, I was God once. Say what? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! No, I'm Santa Claus!

I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.

No argument here. I can explain. It's very valuable. Ooh, name it after me! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Do a flip! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Why did you bring us here?
