## With gusto.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I love you, buddy! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. I had more, but you go ahead. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

## You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'll get my kit! It's toe-tappingly tragic!

1. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
2. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!
3. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

### And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I'm Santa Claus! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Do a flip!

- It's toe-tappingly tragic!
- This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
- What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't veryâ€¦

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Pansy. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Then we'll go with that data file! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Shut up and take my money!

It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Now what?

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Okay, I like a challenge. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Noooooo! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. How much did you make me? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
