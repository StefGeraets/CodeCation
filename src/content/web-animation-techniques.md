## Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Hey, whatcha watching? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

Do a flip! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

## Why would I want to know that?

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. You are the last hope of the universe. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

1. I can explain. It's very valuable.
2. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
3. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

### Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

Really?! No, I'm Santa Claus! That's not soon enough! It must be wonderful. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

- You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
- Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
- That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Shut up and take my money! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

We don't have a brig. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I'm Santa Claus! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Daylight and everything. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

No. We're on the top. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

You don't know how to do any of those. Now what? Okay, I like a challenge. Who am I making this out to? Do a flip!

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Kif might! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

What are their names? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Moving along…

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Your best is an idiot! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Look, last night was a mistake. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

No, I'm Santa Claus! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Soothe us with sweet lies.
