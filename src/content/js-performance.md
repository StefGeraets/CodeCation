## This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Fatal. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

## And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Ow, my spirit! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

1. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
2. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
3. But I've never been to the moon!

### Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

- Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
- Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
- I had more, but you go ahead.

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. And I'm his friend Jesus. You lived before you met me?! Why would a robot need to drink? What are their names?

Who are those horrible orange men? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Really?!

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Leela's gonna kill me. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! But existing is basically all I do! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

No, she'll probably make me do it. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! You don't know how to do any of those. No. We're on the top.

Actually, that's still true. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

You know, I was God once. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
