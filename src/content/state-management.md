## Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Throw her in the brig. I never loved you. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

Fatal. Tell her she looks thin. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

## Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Soon enough. Why would I want to know that? One hundred dollars. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

1. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
2. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
3. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

### Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

- One hundred dollars.
- You know, I was God once.
- Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Is the Space Pope reptilian!?

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Tell her she looks thin. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. No argument here. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Do a flip! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Shut up and take my money! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

Why did you bring us here? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

Do a flip! Leela's gonna kill me. Say what? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! A true inspiration for the children. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Kif might! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I don't want to be rescued. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?
