## I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Take me to your leader! Negative, bossy meat creature! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

Yeah, lots of people did. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! It's toe-tappingly tragic! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

## Ummm…to eBay?

Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

1. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
2. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
3. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

### When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Kif might! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

- I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
- With gusto.
- I'm a thing.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

What are their names? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I can explain. It's very valuable.

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Professor, make a woman out of me. Ummm…to eBay? Noooooo!

Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

I'll get my kit! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! She also liked to shut up! Oh God, what have I done?

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Take me to your leader! Moving along… Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
