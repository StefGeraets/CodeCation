## Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

I'll get my kit! No! The cat shelter's on to me. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

## I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

Fatal. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

1. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
2. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
3. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

### I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

- Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
- Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.
- Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Why yes! Thanks for noticing.

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Really?! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

It must be wonderful. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! What are their names?

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. And then the battle's not so bad? You lived before you met me?! And until then, I can never die?

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Then we'll go with that data file! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

That's not soon enough! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Who am I making this out to? I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You know, I was God once. No, she'll probably make me do it. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Negative, bossy meat creature!
