<h1>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</h1>
<p>
	I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the
	floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? And until then, I can never die? Ah, the
	'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
</p>
<p>
	For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Oh no! The professor will hit
	me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! It must be wonderful. Hey, tell me something.
	You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
</p>
<h2>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</h2>
<p>
	Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine
	robot sisters are dating humans! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest
	easier not knowing where they are.
</p>

	<li>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</li>
	<li>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</li>
	<li>Large bet on myself in round one.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why would I want to know that?</h3>
<p>
	What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Bender, we're trying our
	best. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the
	dead. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

	<li>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And until then, I can never die? I love you, buddy! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! When the
	lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Dear God,
	they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
</p>
<p>
	Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Large bet
	on myself in round one. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I'm sure those windmills will
	keep them cool.
</p>
<p>
	Hey, whatcha watching? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long,
	the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and
	watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his
	acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
</p>
<p>
	Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Shut up and take my money! Our love isn't any
	different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Is that a cooking show? Soon
	enough. Say what?
</p>
<p>
	I just told you! You've killed me! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You
	wouldn't. Ask anyway! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Look,
	everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?
</p>
<p>
	I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Hey, tell me something. You've
	got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? I just told you!
	You've killed me!
</p>
<p>
	Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. That's
	not soon enough! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I
	could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
</p>
<p>
	Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the
	reception isn't very… Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
</p>
<p>
	Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. I've been there. My folks
	were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? We'll need to have a
	look inside you with this camera.
</p>
<p>
	Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual
	inhibitions? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase 'upside
	your head.'
</p>
<p>
	And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one
	day to go. The toilet. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.
	You even love anyone pretending to be him!
